# python-chain
POC of blockchain using python. Based on Haseeb Qureshi's presentation: https://github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/lets-build-a-blockchain

The front end is an api, developped with flask_restplus to generate a swagger interface

goal is to be able to start several clients on localhost with different ports and have the blockchain broadcasted between the nodes.
